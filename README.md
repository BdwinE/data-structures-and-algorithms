# data-structures-and-algorithms
This repo is aimed at displaying and deepening my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. 
It serves as both a personal learning resource and a showcase of my progress and understanding of fundamental computer science concepts. 
Here, you will find a collection of implementations, practice problems, and notes on various data structures and algorithms, ranging from the basics to more advanced topics.

## Goals:
- To deepen my understanding of core data structures and algorithms.
- To practice implementing these concepts in code and solve problems efficiently.
- To build a comprehensive resource that tracks my growth and learning in this area.

## Contents:
- Data Structures: Implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, and more.
- Algorithms: Sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and other algorithmic techniques.
- Practice Problems: Solutions to various problems from online coding platforms(such as LeetCode) that apply these concepts.
- Notes & Resources: Summaries, explanations, and resources that help solidify my understanding of these topics.

## Languages Used:
- Primarily using languages such as Node.js, Python, and Java with the possibility of exploring other languages.

Feel free to explore, learn, and give feedback. This repository will continue to grow as I progress in my study of Data Structures and Algorithms.
