# Fibonacci Sequence

## Summary

The Fibonacci Sequence is a simple algorithm
in which you start with two numbers and to produce the
next number in the sequence you add the last two numbers

## Algorithm

1. Start with two numbers
2. add previous to numbers to get the next
3. update value of previous two numbers
4. repeat steps 2 and 3 n times.

## Example

0 1 -> 0 1 (0+1) -> 0 1 1 (1+1) -> 0 1 1 2 (1+2) -> 0 1 1 2 3 (3+2) -> 0 1 1 2 3 5 ... f(n) = f(n-2) + f(n-1)
